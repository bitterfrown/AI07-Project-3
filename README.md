# Project 3: Image Classification to Classify Concretes With or Without Cracks

## 1.0 Introduction
This project has been carried out to identify cracks on concretes by using a convolutional neural network, CNN with high accuracy. The dataset is obtained from [here](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/5y9wdsg2zt/2). The dataset contains concrete images with cracks. The dataset is further divided into two as negative and positive crack images for image classification. Each class has 20000images with a total of 40000 images with 227 x 227 pixels with RGB channels.
